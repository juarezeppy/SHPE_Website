              The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers at the University of
              California, Irvine has impacted the lives of many students within the
              organization. Since the revival of the chapter in 2009, SHPE at UCI has
              grown significantly in both membership and recognition. The executive board
              members and general members grow by the five pillars of SHPE: Academics,
              Professional Development, Leadership Development, Chapter Development and
              Community Outreach.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the year of 2016, SHPE at UCI has demonstrated initiative to heavily
              recruit, retain, aid members attain post-graduate success. For this reason
              SHPE at UCI has been awarded, “Most Improved Engineering Student
              Organization”, “Student Organization of the Month”, and “Student
              Organization of the Year” by the University of California, Irvine.

              SHPE at UCI strives to make everyone a part of something big. The chapter
              provides different committees that expose members to what board members do
              to help the organization strive. Currently, there are three committee: SHPE
              JR (High School Outreach) Committee, Events Planning Committee, and
              Professional Committee. Each committee offers unique opportunities that help
              members become the leaders they envision.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, SHPE at UCI takes chapter development to a higher dimension by
              creating a sense of “familia”. The chapter successfully integrates new
              members, thus creating a very inclusive environment that represents a “home
              away from home” for various members. Through the various sub-committees and
              activities there’s an opportunity to get involved. SHPE members vary in all
              years and members that have classes in common quickly bond and become close.
              Since many members come from similar backgrounds, and have similar goals,
              SHPE has the mindset that they can all succeed together.
